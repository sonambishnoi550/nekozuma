The story centers around 3 eras of cats living in different timelines - past, present, future. In each timeline, there are 3 deities that are all powerful and are meant to protect the world of Nekos.</p>
          <p className='story-pera text-center mx-auto pt-36 px-3 fs-6'>However at every junction in time, there is always a darkness that is waiting to overthrow the good. Hence, each timeline has its own arch nemesis. This means that there will be a total of 4 godly nekos from each timeline making a total of 12 godly nekos that will be fully animated.</p>
